            content: `<p>The Black Knight satellite conspiracy theory claims that a spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin is in near-polar orbit of the Earth, and that NASA is covering up its existence and origin. This conspiracy theory combines several unrelated stories into one narrative.
                      A photo taken during the STS-88 mission claimed by some to show the Black Knight satellite is catalogued by NASA as a photo of space debris, and space journalist James Oberg considers it as probable debris of a thermal blanket confirmed as lost during the mission.</p>
                      <p>According to some UFO conspiracists, the Black Knight is an artificial satellite of extraterrestrial origin that has orbited Earth for approximately 13,000 years; the "satellite" story is most likely a conflation of several disconnected stories about various objects and their interpretations, all of them well documented independently and none using the term Black Knight upon their first publication. According to senior education support officer Martina Redpath of Armagh Planetarium in Northern Ireland:
                      Black Knight is a jumble of completely unrelated stories; reports of unusual science observations, authors promoting fringe ideas, classified spy satellites and people over-interpreting photos. These ingredients have been chopped up, stirred together and stewed on the internet to one rambling and inconsistent dollop of myth.
                      The origin of the Black Knight legend is often "retrospectively dated" back to natural extraterrestrial repeating sources supposedly heard during the 1899 radio experiments of Nikola Tesla and long delayed echoes first heard by amateur radio operator Jørgen Hals in Oslo, Norway, in 1928. Brian Dunning of the Skeptoid podcast attributes Tesla's 1899 radio signals to pulsars, which were not identified until 1968.
                      In 1954, UFO researcher Donald Keyhoe told newspapers that the United States Air Force had reported that two satellites orbiting Earth had been detected. At that time, no country had the technology to launch a satellite. Skeptics have noted that Keyhoe had been promoting a UFO book at the time, and the news stories were likely written "tongue-in-cheek" and not intended to be taken seriously.
                      A British rocket called the Black Knight rocket was used in conjunction with the Blue Streak missile program between 1958 and 1965, to test re-entry vehicles. A "Black Knight satellite launcher" project announced in 1964 was considered a priority by the Ministry of Aviation. The program never put anything into orbit, and it is unrelated to the Black Knight satellite legend.
                      In February 1960, Time reported that the U.S. Navy had detected a dark object thought to be a Soviet spy satellite in orbit. A follow-up article confirmed that the object was "the remains of an Air Force Discoverer 8 satellite that had gone astray."
                      In 1963, astronaut Gordon Cooper supposedly reported a UFO sighting during his 15th orbit in Mercury 9 that was confirmed by tracking stations, but there is no evidence that this happened. Neither NASA's mission transcripts nor Cooper's personal copies show any such report being made during the orbit.
                      In 1973, Scottish author Duncan Lunan analysed the long delayed radio echoes received by Hals and others and speculated that they could possibly originate from a 13,000 year old alien probe located in an orbit around the Earth's Moon. He suggested that the probe may have originated from a planet located in the planetary system of star Epsilon Boötis. Lunan later retracted his conclusions, saying that he had made "outright errors" and that his methods had been "unscientific".
                      Space debris photographed in 1998 during the STS-88 mission has been widely claimed to be the Black Knight satellite. Space journalist James Oberg considers it probable that the photographs are of a thermal blanket that was confirmed as lost during an EVA by Jerry L. Ross and James H. Newman.</p>`

            category: "Earth Mysteries",
            glow: "blue",
            content: `<p>Agartha (variously spelled as Agharta, Aghartta, Agharti, among many other spellings) is a legendary kingdom that is said to be located on the inner surface of the Earth. Though the exact story varies, as there are many different versions, it is usually said to be located in Central Asia and led by a powerful figure sometimes called the King of the World, who secretly influences the surface. Later versions connect it to the belief in a hollow Earth. The idea of Agartha has been a popular subject in esotericism, occultism, and the New Age since the late 19th century.
                      The term and concept dates to the 1870s, first introduced by the French writer and colonial official Louis Jacolliot in his 1873 book Les fils de Dieu. Jacolliot claimed that he had been given access to ancient 15,000-year-old Indian manuscripts which told of the ancient city of Asgartha, its rise, and its fall. The original idea did not involve an underground kingdom, but was said to be India's destroyed former capital city, and is closer to Norse mythology than Indian mythology in content. Jacolliot's book was popular in France, and the concept of Agartha gained traction. The concept was afterwards expanded upon by a variety of occultist writers, including Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre. Saint-Yves wrote on it in his book Mission de l'Inde en Europe, which portrayed Agartha as still existing within the Earth, where one could travel through astral projection.
                      The idea was popularized by Ferdynand Ossendowski's 1922 book Beasts, Men and Gods, which was heavily influenced by Saint-Yves's version and became the standard version of Agartha's myth. Some interpretations involve Nordicism or Aryanism. A derived belief is that of the Grand Lodge of Agartha, a concept in Theosophy and related movements, where a group of ascended masters who secretly control the world are said to reside in Agartha. For unclear reasons, it is frequently associated or confused with the Buddhist mythical kingdom Shambhala, alternatively seen as a rival power, with either Agartha as the good to Shambhala's evil, or both as evil.</p> <br>
                      <p>Agartha is an immense legendary kingdom that is said to be located on the inner surface of the Earth, sometimes involving a "King of the World" or multiple kings, who are said to rule Agartha, who secretly influence the events of the surface world. It is typically said to be located somewhere underneath Central Asia, or alternatively Tibet or the Himalayas. Variations of the story mention different hidden entrances to Agartha, which vary by telling, but have included Ayers Rock, the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Earth's poles, Mato Grosso, the Gobi Desert, Cueva de los Tayos, or in Kentucky. It is sometimes related to the belief in a hollow Earth, or as the Earth's hidden spiritual center. Agartha has been a popular subject in esotericism and occultism since the late 19th century. It is also popular in New Age thought and in alternative reality subcultures, though it receives little attention from most modern occultist researchers. There are numerous different versions of the story and circumstances of Agartha, most of which are inconsistent with each other. The earliest version did not involve the underground kingdom elements. It may have been taken in part from previous stories of hidden lands in occultism, such as Lemuria, Hyperborea, and Atlantis.
                      Many Theosophy groups or derived groups share a belief in the Grand Lodge of Agartha, which is made up of ascended masters who secretly control the world. The Order of the Solar Temple was one such group, though they also believed in Agartha generally, and believed in ascended masters living underground in the advanced civilization of Agartha. Notoriously, Solar Temple members ended up committing mass murder-suicide throughout the 1990s, partially rationalizing this as completing the "cycle" started by the Grand Lodge of Agartha. Separately, Dwight York, leader of the Nuwaubian Nation, titled one of his books Shamballah and Aghaarta. Cities Within the Earth. The Polaires movement believed they communicated with an oracle through number and name manipulation, through which they could communicate with the "Rosicrucian Initiatic Center of 'Mysterious' Asia", led by sages who lived in Agartha. Some writers have alleged connections between the Nazis and Agartha, which have no evidence.</p>`

                       The Hollow Earth is a concept proposing that the planet Earth is entirely hollow or contains a substantial interior space. Notably suggested by Edmond Halley in the late 17th century, the notion was disproven, first tentatively by Pierre Bouguer in 1740, then definitively by Charles Hutton in his Schiehallion experiment around 1774.
                       It was still occasionally defended through the mid-19th century, notably by John Cleves Symmes Jr. and J. N. Reynolds, but by this time it was part of popular pseudoscience and no longer a scientifically viable hypothesis.
                       The concept of a hollow Earth still recurs in folklore and as a premise for subterranean fiction, a subgenre of adventure fiction. Hollow Earth also recurs in conspiracy theories and the Cryptoterrestrial hypothesis and is often said to be inhabited by mythological figures or political leaders.</p>`

                       <p><b>Existential threat</b><br>
                       If our universe is in a false vacuum state rather than a true vacuum state, then the decay from the less stable false vacuum to the more stable true vacuum (called false vacuum decay) could have dramatic consequences. The effects could range from complete cessation of existing fundamental forces, elementary particles and structures comprising them, to subtle change in some cosmological parameters, mostly depending on the potential difference between true and false vacuum. Some false vacuum decay scenarios are compatible with the survival of structures like galaxies, stars, and even biological life, while others involve the full destruction of baryonic matter or even immediate gravitational collapse of the universe. In this more extreme case, the likelihood of a "bubble" forming is very low (i.e. one in 10 to the 868 power or false vacuum decay may even be impossible).
                       A paper by Coleman and De Luccia that attempted to include simple gravitational assumptions into these theories noted that if this was an accurate representation of nature, then the resulting universe "inside the bubble" in such a case would appear to be extremely unstable and would almost immediately collapse:
                       In general, gravitation makes the probability of vacuum decay smaller; in the extreme case of minimal energy-density difference, it can even stabilize the false vacuum, preventing vacuum decay altogether. We believe we understand this. For the vacuum to decay, building a bubble of total energy zero must be possible. In the absence of gravitation, this is no problem, no matter how small the energy-density difference; all one has to do is make the bubble big enough, and the volume/surface ratio will do the job. In the presence of gravitation, though, the negative energy density of the true vacuum distorts geometry within the bubble with the result that, for a small enough energy density, there is no bubble with a big enough volume/surface ratio. Within the bubble, the effects of gravitation are more dramatic. The geometry of space-time within the bubble is that of anti-de Sitter space, a space much like conventional de Sitter space except that its group of symmetries is O(3, 2) rather than O(4, 1). Although this space-time is free of singularities, it is unstable under small perturbations, and inevitably suffers gravitational collapse of the same sort as the end state of a contracting Friedmann universe. The time required for the collapse of the interior universe is on the order of ... microseconds or less.
                       The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it. Nonetheless, one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps over time the new vacuum would sustain if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy. This possibility has now been eliminated.
                       The second special case is decay into a space of vanishing cosmological constant, the case that applies if we are now living in the debris of a false vacuum that decayed at some early cosmic epoch. This case presents us with less interesting physics and with fewer occasions for rhetorical excess than the preceding one. It is now the interior of the bubble that is ordinary Minkowski space ...
                       — Sidney Coleman and Frank De Luccia
                       In a 2005 paper published in Nature, as part of their investigation into global catastrophic risks, MIT physicist Max Tegmark and Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom calculate the natural risks of the destruction of the Earth at less than 1/109 per year from all natural (i.e. non-anthropogenic) events, including a transition to a lower vacuum state. They argue that due to observer selection effects, we might underestimate the chances of being destroyed by vacuum decay because any information about this event would reach us only at the instant when we too were destroyed. This is in contrast to events like risks from impacts, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and hypernovae, the frequencies of which we have adequate direct measures.</p>`

            content: `<p>In cosmology, eternal inflation is a prediction of some forms of the model of cosmic inflation, a theory developed to explain issues in the original Big Bang theory. According to eternal inflation, the decay of the meta-stable false vacuum in one region led to the inflationary phase of the universe's expansion. In surrounding regions, the false vacuum continues to expand and decay can occur in surrounding regions, resulting in other universes inaccessibly distant from ours. This process lasts forever. Eternal inflation, therefore, produces a hypothetically infinite multiverse, in which only an insignificant fractal volume ends inflation.
                      Paul Steinhardt, one of the original researchers of the inflationary model, introduced the first example of eternal inflation in 1983, and Alexander Vilenkin showed that it is generic.
                      Alan Guth's 2007 paper, "Eternal inflation and its implications", states that under reasonable assumptions "Although inflation is generically eternal into the future, it is not eternal into the past". Guth detailed what was known about the subject at the time, and demonstrated that eternal inflation was still considered the likely outcome of inflation, more than 20 years after eternal inflation was first introduced by Steinhardt.</p>`
